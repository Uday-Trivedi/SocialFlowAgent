Starter Plan

The Starter plan is intended for small businesses, solo founders, and individuals who are beginning to automate customer conversations. This plan focuses on basic conversation automation and lead capture.

The Starter plan supports one platform, such as Instagram, Facebook Messenger, or website chat. It allows a limited number of conversations per month and includes automated replies to direct messages and basic questions.

This plan includes simple lead capture, where the AI agent can collect an email address or name when a user shows interest. Advanced intent detection and lead qualification are limited in this plan.

The Starter plan is best suited for businesses with low message volume that want faster responses without hiring additional staff.

The Growth plan allows the AI agent to ask follow-up questions, qualify leads, and capture detailed contact information such as business type and use case. Conversations can be handed over to human team members when needed.

This plan is suitable for businesses that rely on social media and website inquiries for sales or customer acquisition.
